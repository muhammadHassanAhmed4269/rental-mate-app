              To lend an item, simply create a listing on our website. Be sure
              to include a description of the item, photos, and your <br />{" "}
              availability. Once your listing is active, other users will be
              able to browse and borrow it. <br /> To borrow an item, simply
              search for what you need on our website. Once you've found an item
              you're interested in, contact <br /> the lender to arrange the
              borrowing
